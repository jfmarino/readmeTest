#SDKNAMESdk

##Setup

To initialize the SDK you must first provide a base URL for your backend server. Then, all you need to do is call the init method on SDKNAMESdk.

```javascript
SDKNAMESdk.baseUrl = "https://www.foo.com";
SDKNAMESdk.init();
```

If your application is *DirectToSource* then you can skip the base URL setup.
