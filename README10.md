## <a name="adding-the-sdk-to-your-application"></a> Adding the SDK to your Application

In order to include this SDK within your Application simply take the file `ap_sdk.js`, found in the SDK folder at the root level. This file contains the entire SDK code in one file **without** the dependencies like JQuery. Take that file and copy it anywhere you want within you Application folder structure and just include it in your `index.html` using a <scriptÌ£/\> tag.

### <a name="dependencies"></a> Dependencies

All the SDK dependencies can be found in the path *SDK_ROOT/sdk/lib/*, where SDK_ROOT is the folder where this SDK is. You must add this dependencies for the SDK to work properly, however, note that you can download this dependencies yourself if you wish, **you don't have to use** the ones in the lib folder specifically, they are included there as a convenience.

## <a name="setup-and-initialize-the-sdk"></a> Setup and Initialize the SDK

To initialize the SDK you must first provide a base URL for your backend server. Then, all you need to do is call the init method on ThemableSdk.

```javascript
AP.baseUrl = "https://www.foo.com";
ThemableSdk.init();
```

If your application is *DirectToSource* then you can skip the base URL setup.

## <a name="local-caching"></a> Local Caching

Local caching can be toggled easily by setting the value of the Application variable `useOfflineCache` **before** initializing the SDK.

```javascript
ThemableSdk.useOfflineCache = true;
ThemableSdk.init();
```

If you would like to activate it **after** initialization, you can use the method `initOfflineCache` on the SDK.

```javascript
ThemableSdk.initOfflineCache();
```

Keep in mind that once local caching has been enabled it cannot be disabled in runtime.

## <a name="authentication"></a> Authentication

Before you can authenticate with the SDK in your application  you must create an Auth Object in the Anypresence Designer and a user in your application's back end.

```javascript
// login
AP.auth.Authentication.login({
  username: 'test',
  password: 'password'
});

// logout
AP.auth.Authentication.logout();
```

## <a name="file-uploads"></a> File Uploads

Models in the SDK may have fields which are files. Uploading files is already baked into the Model class, so just set that field to a file and use the `.save()` method in the model. If you would like to remove a file, just set that same field to `null` and save it. Use an input with type "file" to get the file.

```html
<input id="my-files" type="file">
```
```javascript
var file = $('#my-files')[0].files[0];
model.set('fileAttribute', file);
model.save();
```

Once a file has been uploaded, the contents of that field will be replaced for a URI string to locate the file itself.

## <a name="models"></a> Models

Available Model objects:

* Employee


### <a name="employee"></a>`Employee`


#### <a name="create-employee"></a>Create

To create instances of `Employee` do:

```javascript
var exampleModel = new ThemableSdk.models.Employee();

exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model save method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) documentation for more information.

#### <a name="read-employee"></a>Read

To read a specific instance by id you can do:

```javascript
var singleInstance = new ThemableSdk.models.Employee({
  id: 1
});

singleInstance.fetch({
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-fetch) documentation for more information.

#### <a name="update-employee"></a>Update

Updating a Employee Model is very similar to creating one. Updating is done by calling the save method on an already persisted object.

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" });
```

Updating the Model this way will cause a `PUT` request to be triggered, if you would like to send a `PATCH` request instead, then you should call like so:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {patch: true});
```

Just like in Model creation, even if you are not updating all Model attributes, a complete representation is sent to the server.

#### <a name="delete-employee"></a>Delete

To delete an instance:

```javascript
// using delete
exampleModel.delete({
  success: function(model, response, options) {...},
  error: function(model, response, options) {...}
});

// using destroy
exampleModel.destroy({
  success: function(model, response, options) {...},
  error: function(model, response, options) {...}
});
```

The `success` and `error` callback are optional as with other Backbone CRUD method calls.


#### <a name="query-scopes-employee"></a>Query Scopes


The available query scopes for `Employee` are:

* all
* exact_match
* count
* count_exact_match

##### `EmployeeAll`


```javascript
var EmployeeAll = new ThemableSdk.collections.EmployeeAll();

EmployeeAll.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Collection fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-fetch) documentation for more information.


##### `EmployeeExactMatch`


```javascript
var EmployeeExactMatch = new ThemableSdk.collections.EmployeeExactMatch();

EmployeeExactMatch.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Collection fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-fetch) documentation for more information.


##### `EmployeeCount`


```javascript
var EmployeeCount = new ThemableSdk.collections.EmployeeCount();

EmployeeCount.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// to access the value
var value = EmployeeCount.valueOf();
```

##### `EmployeeCountExactMatch`


```javascript
var EmployeeCountExactMatch = new ThemableSdk.collections.EmployeeCountExactMatch();

EmployeeCountExactMatch.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// to access the value
var value = EmployeeCountExactMatch.valueOf();
```





## <a name="development"></a> Development

This sections shows the dependencies and steps to develop or modify this SDK.

### Developing with Grunt

Grunt is a NodeJS-based task runner.  It helps automate common tasks, such as
asset compilation, minification, and testing.  Grunt tasks are included for this
SDK in `Gruntfile.js`.

Follow directions below to get up and running with Grunt.

#### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)

#### Install NodeJS Modules

From the root directory of the SDK (where `Gruntfile.js` is
located), install NodeJS modules:

    npm install

#### Adding code to the SDK

In order to add additional files to the final SDK build all that is required is to include the file within the building process.
The build process is actually just concatenation of all the modules and files that comprise the SDK, so to add more you can modify `Gruntfile.js` found in the root of the SDK folder.

```
concat: {
  javascript: {
    src: [
      // A lot of files that make the SDK are listes here
      'sdk/ap/**.js',
      ...
      // You can add your files anywhere you want within the list they don't need to be at the bottom
      // However, note that if your code depends on any of the default SDK code you will need to add it after all the other files
      // or at least after the stuff you depend on.
      'path/to/my/code.js',
      ...
    ],
    dest: 'ap_sdk.js'
  }
},
```

After you add your files, just build the SDK with the steps below and your code will be added to `ap_sdk.js`

#### Build for Production

To compile assets and create a full production build, run the
build task:

    grunt build

#### Automatic Compilation & Testing

Since it's cumbersome to manually compile assets after every change during
development, the SDK's `Gruntfile.js` includes a `watch` task.  The
task monitors changes to the SDK's `coffee` and `sass` assets,
automatically compiling (but not minifying) them.  Run the following command
before making changes:

    grunt watch

## <a name="testing"></a> Testing

The SDK comes with a complete test suite.  Execute tests from grunt:

`grunt test`

SDK tests are also executed by the `watch` task.  If changing the SDK
significantly, some or all tests may fail.  You may disable auto-testing by
editing the `watch` task in `Gruntfile.js`.

The test suite can also be run directly in a browser.  Open `test/index.html` and click
"Run Tests".
